firstbot
A Reddit Crawler
By: Adam Hodges
------------------------
firstbot was an idea that I came up with while browsing reddit.com in my free time.
Authors submit "rage comics" to a particular section of reddit, and other users rate them.
Many first timers add a "first tag", [first], to the title of their comic as a plea for mercy and a higher rating.

I have always wondered how many people tag their comics as [first] even after their first comic. No one ever checks.

While it's doubtful that someone would actually get a measurably higher rating from the abuse of a [first] tag, I decided it would make a cool project.

firstbot is a reddit crawler that identifies and reprimands abusers of the [first] tag in rage comic submissions.

Execution
------------------------
To run firstbot:
    python firstbot.py

Dependencies
------------------------
firstbot was written using Python 2.7.2 and SQLite 3.7.7.

Thanks
------------------------
I would like to give the author of another reddit bot, originalfinder, a shoutout for inspiring me!
